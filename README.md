# ATM_Challenge_2021_Ruby _Project

By Shagufta Batool


**What the Code does!**


In ATM_challenge project, I  created a unit test cases for various conditions that could happen in reality and created the test cases where the ATM response accordingly. In this project has been created  only by creating the  logical tier, there is no user interface (UI) in this project.


***Dependencies***


The project has been created  using Ruby programming Language solely.
Rspec framework has been used for the unit testing which is one of many testing framework for  Ruby. 


***Setup***


To run the code on computer I have to  create Gemfile in root directory of the project and installed   bundle via  Ubuntu CLI 
This will install the dependencies that is required to run the test. I have used VStudio code editor for coding.


***Instructions***


To run the program we have to use  CLI . We have to change the command path to our project directory. Since there is on user interface, we will use $rspec command to test the different units of our project.


-***Acknowledgments***

I am thankful to my coach Thomas Ochman and all my fellow students whose different way of coding and tackling the problem  helped me to complete this project.


***Updates/Improvement plans***


The program at this stage does not have any user interface and some other  important functionality to make it more interactive and effective. So my  plans are to implement more user functionality with nice user interface.  


***License***


The software is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.
